# Agendista - web client

This is a proof-of-concept front end for an online appointment manager. The use cases are based in 
the needs of a business / organization booking client appointments:
* Managing appointments
* Managing customers
* Defining available services
* Defining business hours, holidays and vacation time

As of October 2019, the application has no logic and mostly navigates between different screens.
